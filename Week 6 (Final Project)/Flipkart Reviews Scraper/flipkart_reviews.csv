THE SMALL INSTRUMENTS MUSIC ARE LISTENING VERY GOOD. 3. DRIVER SIZE IS 11MM BUT BASS QUALITY IS NOT UPTO THE MARK ON SIMPLE MUSIC PLAYERS. 4. USE POWERAMP MUSIC PLAYER FOR BEST BASS EXPERIENCE. 5. GREAT STEREO EXPERIENCE. 6. THE BUDS CASE IS VERY GLOSSY AND GETTING SCRATCHES VERY QUICKLY. 7. ONLY ONE INDICATOR LIGHT IS...
4,Pros_1) very good for music. 2) value for money product. 3) Primium design and decent battery backup. Cons_1)Not good for calling. 2) Absence of noise cancellation. I'm giving this review after a month of use as I have experienced....😊 Note_The delivery guy was so humble...👏
4,"Fit looks good. Sound quality is just fine. Too many controls on ear buds. Double tap, long tap, triple tap, etc. Too many accidental touches.  No options to disable them. Case build is also average. Value for money is good"

5,"Today only I received this earbuds, the base is good and all I am feeling ok the product is moral just fine the voice and calling experience is also very good and the music is totally clear and let's see I will update this review after 2 month of use... The only thing is you have only one indicator that is in the bottom of it beside the charging point from there only you will get to know whether the your buds are charging or not that is only the backdrop nothing else is the music and clarity ..."
4,"Benefits :- cheap, fits properly in ur ear, sound quality is better, battery backup is good, good design. Know worse things:- bass is too solid that voice truely becomes a noise in ur ears, range to the connected device is around 10 mtrs. But still is a very good call in this range. I conside it to be purchased."
